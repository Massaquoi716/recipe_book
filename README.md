# recipe_book
##Welcome to our first collaborative recipe book project!
In this project,  each team member will be responsible for creating their own branch and adding their recipe to the book. This will allow us to collaborate efficiently while keeping track of all changes made to the project.

##GOAL
Throughout the project, you will learn how to use Git and GitHub to create, commit, and push changes to your own branches. You will also learn how to merge changes from other branches and resolve conflicts that may arise during the process.
