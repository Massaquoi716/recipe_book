Recipe for new spaghetti Bolognese.

Methods

STEP 1
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan and crumble in the mince and sausagemeat.
 Spend a good 30 minutes cooking the mince – it will release lots of liquid, which you want to 
 evaporate, and then eventually it will end up sizzling in its fat. If the pan becomes too dry, 
 drizzle in a little more olive oil. Towards the end, continue stirring the mince until it becomes
  speckled with crisp brown bits

STEP 2
Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 2. While the mince is browning, heat a drizzle more oil in a casserole
 dish and sizzle the pancetta for 5 mins until it starts to brown and release its fat, then throw in
the vegetables and herbs, and finely crumble over the dried porcini. Cook gently for 5 mins until
soft and starting to brown. Sprinkle over the sugar, then stir in the tomato purée and splash in 
the fish sauce and vinegar. Simmer down until gloopy, then stir through the meat and pour in the
milk and tomatoes. Rinse out the tomato tins with the wine and stir into the pan. Season, then nestle
 in the parmesan rind. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook in the oven for 3 hrs.

STEP 3
When cooked, tip as many portions of Bolognese as you need into a sauté pan. Cook the pasta until 
very al dente, then tong into the pan with a bit of the water and finish cooking with the sauce for 
2 mins. Stir through the parmesan and a drizzle more olive oil. Twirl the pasta and Bolognese into 
bowls, scatter with basil and serve with more parmesan.
