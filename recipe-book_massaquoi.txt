A simple recipe for homemade chocolate ice cream:

**Ingredients:**

- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (optional, for added texture)

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Ice Cream Maker:**
   If you have an ice cream maker, ensure that the bowl is frozen according to the manufacturer's instructions. If you don't have an ice cream maker, you can still make ice cream using a shallow container that you can place in the freezer.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder and sugar until well combined. This helps to prevent lumps in the ice cream.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
   In a separate bowl, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, and vanilla extract. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved.

4. **Combine Mixtures:**
   Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, whisking continuously to ensure a smooth mixture. Make sure the cocoa and sugar are fully incorporated.

5. **Chill the Mixture:**
   Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for at least 2-4 hours, or preferably overnight. Chilling the mixture enhances the flavor and texture of the ice cream.

6. **Freeze the Ice Cream:**
   If using an ice cream maker, pour the chilled mixture into the machine and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. If not using an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into a shallow container and place it in the freezer.

7. **Add Chocolate Chips (Optional):**
   About halfway through the freezing process, when the ice cream has thickened, add the chocolate chips or chopped chocolate. This step is optional but adds extra chocolatey goodness and texture.

8. **Finish Freezing:**
   Continue freezing until the ice cream reaches your desired consistency. If using a container, stir the ice cream every 30 minutes during the initial freezing stages to prevent ice crystals from forming.

9. **Serve or Store:**
   Once the ice cream reaches the desired consistency, it's ready to be served. Scoop into bowls or cones and enjoy! If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the freezer.

Now you have a delicious batch of homemade chocolate ice cream! Feel free to get creative and add your favorite toppings or serve it alongside other desserts.
